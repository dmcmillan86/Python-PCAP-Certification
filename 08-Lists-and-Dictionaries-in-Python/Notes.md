# Lists and Dictionaries in Python

## Oredering Values in List
List is similar to an array in other programming lanagues
List allow us to store multiple discrete values in a single variable
List are Ordered - Indexed
List are Dynamically Typed - Mixed
List are mutable (changeable)
values in list are indexed so the to call the first value you would utilize a zero(0)

List []
Tuples ()
SETS {}
Tuples are immutable and ordered list 
sets are unordered immutable list

## Naming Items with Dictionaries

dictionaries allow for storing multiple discrete values in a single variable
Dictionaries are ordered, dynamically typed, mutable and KEYED
Dictionaries utilized as {"key1" : "value1", "key2" : "Value2" }
List can be nested in Dictionaries and
Dicitionaries can be nested in list
A dictionary is like a list of key-value pairs

## Working with Dictionaries

Iterate through dicts keys with 'for' loop
.keys() return something like a list of keys
.values() return something like a list of values
.items() return something like a list of items
you must cast to a list before you can turn these into a list

.update() appends values into your dictionary
