# Importing and Using Modules in Python

# Importing Modules

Modules allow for code to be divided into self-contained blocks
 - Independence
 - Maintainability
 - Resuability

To use a module it must first be 'installed'
Installed in one of three locations:
  - The local Directory - .py
  - A PYTHONPATH Directory - Env
  - One of the internal (sys.path) Directories - Global

# Using Import and Modules

Modules define their own 'namespace'
Namespace: a logical boundary in code where specific identifiers (names) are created and accessible
Import can import an entire module or pieces of a module and can redefine the namespace name
