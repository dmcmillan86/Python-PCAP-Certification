# Understand Python Strings

## Storing and Manipulating Strings

- Text in python is stores is a series of individcual characters
- Booleans are 1 bit
- 8 bits is 1 byte and 1 byte can store 256 numbers - 2^8
- Typically an int is stored in 4 bytes which is 2^32
- Typically with floating point numbers we store it in 8 bytes of data
- With text we store 1 char per byte. This is where the term string comes from. we string together a bunch of individual bytes to make up our text

#Encoding Strings with ASCII, Unicdoe, UTF-8

ASCII is 1 byte encoding for Latin/English Alphabet
Unicode is 6 Byte codepage for any and all letters, symbols, glyphs, etc
UTF-8 Formula for efficiently storing encoded strings in memory

# Escape Characters for Strings

escape chars are used to id string literals vs control characters

# Operators and String Functions

You can concatenate, repetite, range slice, join, org, char, len and slice strings utilizing operators.
