# Python Operators

Operators are a symbol that tells the interpreter to execut a specific task
Arithmetic, Relational, Logical and BiTwise are types of Operator groups.

= sign is an assignment operator for a variable. It can assign multiple values on one line of code. 
Arithmetic operators inlcude Plus, Minus, Multiply, Divide, Power, Floor, Modulo

Expressions evaluate to a value
Plus and Minus can be Unary as well as Binary

Relational Operators ask a question of that lead to True or False. 
Know the difference between the = sign as it relates to defining a variable and if you want to see if two values EQUAL each other you need to use ==
Relational Operators also utilize the words And, Or, & Not

Combination operators combine two operations into one operator. 
x += 1 is the same as x = x + 1

string operators manipulate text and such:
a plus sign concatenates two strings together. meaning it takes the two strings and puts them together into one single string
an asterik (*) repeats a string
[] closed bracket will slice the string and [:] will range slice the string

Bitwise operators perform BINARY operations
Bitwise AND, Bitwise OR, Bitwise NOT, Bitwise XOR, Shift Right >> and Shift LEFT <<
