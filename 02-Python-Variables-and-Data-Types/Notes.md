# Python Variables and Data Types

## Understanding Variables

- Variables in Python are flexible and dynamic, meaning they can hold different types of data and can change types during the execution of a program.

## Understanding Python Data Types

- A data type refers to the kind of value stored in a variable. Python supports several primitive data types, including:
  - **Numeric Types:** `int` (integer), `float` (floating-point), `complex` (complex numbers)
  - **Sequence Types:** `str` (string), `list`, `tuple`, `range`
  - **Set Types:** `set`, `frozenset`
  - **Binary Types:** `bytes`, `bytearray`, `memoryview`
  - **Mapping Type:** `dict` (dictionary/maps)
  - **Boolean Type:** `bool` (True or False)

- Every variable has a type, which determines how the variable behaves and how it can be used in your code. Understanding data types is essential as it informs everything in your code about how to handle and manipulate the variable.

## Casting Data Types

- Casting is the process of converting a variable from one data type to another using built-in functions such as `int()`, `float()`, and `str()`.
- Not all data types are compatible for conversion. For example, a string containing letters cannot be converted into an integer directly. Itâ€™s important to know which conversions are possible to avoid errors.

## Python Literals

- Literals are fixed values specified in the source code that represent data directly, making it easy to distinguish between code and data.
  - **Numeric Literals:** Examples include `123`, `4.56`
  - **String Literals:** Enclosed in quotation marks, e.g., `"Hello, World!"` or `'Python is fun'`
  - **Boolean Literals:** Always capitalized, `True` and `False`

- Understanding literals helps in identifying specific values within the code and differentiating ambiguous data from operational code.
