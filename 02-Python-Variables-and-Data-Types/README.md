# Understanding Variables
Variables are Flexible and dynamic

# Understanding Pythong Data Types

Variables can change data types anytime during the execution of the program

Data type (Primitives) refers to the kind of value stored. Is it float, integer, String, Boolean, List, Tuple, Range,, Set, Frozenset, bytes, bytearray, memoryview, Maps?
Every value/variable has a type! its going to inform everything in your code on how to treat said variable

# Casting Data Types
 
Casting is simply converting a data type into another data type
Not all Data Types can be converted into another Data Type. Such as a string can not be turned into an integer

# Python Literals

Literals are specified values in source code. They differentiate ambiguous data and separate code from data

Boolean literals are capitalized. True and False
String literals are between quotation marks
