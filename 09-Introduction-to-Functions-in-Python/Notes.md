# Intro to Functions in Python

A function is a defined/names block of code that can be run in the code such as print()
often accepts parameters and/or values that customize the way it operates
many said functions are standards in the python language and many are part of 3rd party libraries and even we can create our own functions for our own coding needs
PyPi is an internet resource for python libraries
Numpy is a popular library for manipulating data

Importing functions must be done at the top of your script
