# Conditionals and Loops in Python

When we write a script in Python remember the code is typical executed sequentially

However, When we get into more dynamic control flow structures our code is no longer sequential. Such as if-then statements which creates two brances of code to possibly execute.
Loops loop through a particular part of the code over and over again until the code predetermined amount of time

Conditional statements create these branches of Code which makes a script more flexible and re-usable. In our If-then-else statement the IF uses relational operators to test the expression and if true the THEN sympbolized by a : is executed, Else ELSE is executed.
elif is another powerhouse code that branches off code

# Iterating Code with While Loops

While loops help eliminate repetitive code. Loops repeat blocks of code multiple times. The While statement uses relational operators to test an expression. A True result causes the code to execut, then return to the while. otherwise, execution skips past the loop block. At some point you do want the loop to stop or else you'll be stuck in what is called an infinite loop. 

# Iterating Code with For Loops

For loops require an iterable object
The code will exectue for each value of the object
Upon its completion code continues

# Conditional and Loop Control

Control Structures can be iterated or ended early by: Break, Continue, Else(looping), Pass
Else, Executes what a loop is finished
Break, exits a loop early and goes to end of code section
Continue, Iterate a loop early
pass, do nothing
