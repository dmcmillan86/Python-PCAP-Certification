### Post 3: Preparing Our Coding Environment

**Python as a Scripting and Programming Language:**

- Python is versatile; it functions well both as a scripting language and as a full programming language.
- **Scripting Languages:** Scripts are delivered and run as plain text files that are interpreted line-by-line at runtime.
- **Programming Languages:** Programs are compiled into executable files before they are delivered and run on the end user's system.
- Python code can be typed directly into the Python interpreter or saved to a file and executed. In most cases, you'll save your code to a file for reusability and easy editing.

**Basic Python Vocabulary:**

- **Binary:** The compiled, executable file on an end user's system.
- **Source Code:** The raw code written in plain text files. This is the code you write and edit.
- **Keywords:** Reserved words in Python that have specific meanings and cannot be used as identifiers (e.g., `def`, `return`, `if`).
- **Brackets [ ] and Parentheses ( ):** Brackets are used for indexing and slicing lists, while parentheses are used for grouping expressions and function calls.

**First Programming Techniques:**

- To run a Python program from the command line, use the following operation: `python your_script.py`
- Python executes code sequentially from top to bottom, line by line.

**Good Programming Techniques:**

- **Good Practices Lead to Good Code:** Writing code that is easy for both computers and humans to understand is essential.
- **One Statement per Line:** Keep your code clean and readable by writing one statement per line.
- **Use Descriptive Names:** Use clear and descriptive names for variables, functions, and classes to make your code more understandable.
- **Include Comments:** Comments are crucial for explaining the purpose of your code, especially for complex or non-obvious sections. Use them liberally to guide anyone reading your code.
- **Reduce Duplication:** Aim to write reusable code by using functions and modules. Avoid repeating code by encapsulating common functionality in reusable components.
