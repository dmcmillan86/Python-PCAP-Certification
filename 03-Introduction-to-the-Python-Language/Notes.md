# Preparing Our Coding Environment

Python is great as a scripting language as well as a programming language. Remember its bytecode.

Scripting language are essentially delivered and run as plain text files
Programs are compiled before delivery

Python can be typed directly into the python interpreter as well as saved to a file and sent to the interpreter. It nearly every case you'll save to a file simply for reusability and editing.

# Basic Python Vocabulary

Binary is the executable file on an end user's system
Source Code is the Raw Code in a plain text file
Keywords are reseved words in python language
Bracket []
Parentheses ()

# Our First Programming Techniques

What is the command-line operation to run a python program - python
code is executed in order from top

# Good Programming Techniques

Good practices lead to good code
Good code is easy for computers and for humans
One statement per line, use descriptive names and INCLUDE COMMENTS
Reduce duplication. re-usable code is valuable
