## Intro

Programming languages are a bridge language between binary and natural language

Python turns to bytecode 
  sent to end user 
  then user's interpreter compiles it 
  Just-in-time Execution

The Python Inerpreter is installed in a specific Directory
It can only be run if the 'user context' is in that directory
PATH makes directories available in ALL CONTEXT
When adding Paths a User defined PATH will take precedence over a System defined PATH

## Choosing a Code Editor

Know that source code is written and saved as plain 'ASCII' text
  Meaning code be written in something as basic as NOTEPAD as long as it's written in the format of said language, it can then be interpreted
