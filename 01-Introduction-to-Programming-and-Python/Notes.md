## Intro to Programming and Python

- Programming languages act as a bridge between binary (machine code) and natural (human) languages, allowing us to communicate instructions to computers effectively.

- **Python Execution Process:**
  - Python code is first turned into bytecode.
  - The bytecode is then sent to the end user.
  - The user's interpreter compiles the bytecode using Just-in-Time (JIT) execution, allowing the program to run on their system.

- **Python Interpreter:**
  - The Python interpreter is installed in a specific directory on your system.
  - It can only be run if the 'user context' is set to that directory.
  - The `PATH` environment variable makes directories available in all contexts, meaning you can run Python from any location on your system if Pythonâ€™s directory is added to `PATH`.
  - When adding directories to the `PATH`, a user-defined path will take precedence over a system-defined path, allowing for greater flexibility in managing different Python installations or versions.

## Choosing a Code Editor

- **Source Code Basics:**
  - Source code is written and saved as plain 'ASCII' text, which means it can be written in basic text editors like Notepad as long as it follows the syntax rules of the language.

- **Integrated Development Environment (IDE):**
  - An IDE (Integrated Development Environment) is a more advanced tool that offers a suite of features, including code editing, debugging, and project management, which simplifies the coding process and improves productivity.
