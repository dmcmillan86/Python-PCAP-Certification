# Advanced Operations with Functions in Python

## Python Variable Scope

Understanding **variable scope** is essential for writing clean, effective Python code. Scope determines where a variable is accessible within your program.

- **Local Scope**: Variables defined within a function are accessible only within that function. These are known as **local variables**.
- **Global Scope**: Variables defined outside of any function are accessible throughout the entire program and are referred to as **global variables**.
- **Global Keyword**: If you need to modify a global variable from within a function, you can use the `global` keyword. This allows the variable inside the function to have **global scope** instead of local.

Variable scope helps prevent unintended side effects and keeps your code organized, ensuring that variables are only accessible where they’re needed.

## Yielding Python Functions

The **`yield`** statement is used to create **generator functions**, which provide a way to produce a sequence of results over time, rather than all at once. 

- **Replacing `return`**: Unlike the `return` statement, which ends function execution and outputs a single result, `yield` **temporarily suspends** the function, saving its state, and allows it to be resumed later. This makes it possible to generate a series of values one at a time.
- **Resuming Execution**: When the function is called again, it picks up where it left off, remembering its state and continuing to yield more results.
- **Iterable Results**: The values generated by a `yield` function are iterable, which means you can loop through them using a `for` loop.

You can also step through the results manually using the `next()` function, which returns the next value from the generator one step at a time.

## Mapping, Filtering, and Reducing

These three techniques—**Mapping**, **Filtering**, and **Reducing**—are core concepts in functional programming. They allow you to operate on sets of data without explicitly writing loops, making your code more efficient and expressive.

- **Mapping**: Applies a transformation to each item in a collection, producing a new collection with transformed values.
  
- **Filtering**: Limits the number of items in a collection based on a condition. Only the items that meet the condition are included in the resulting collection.
  
- **Reducing**: Summarizes elements in a collection as a single value. This is commonly used for operations like summing or finding the maximum. To use reducing techniques, you'll need to import the `functools` module.

These techniques shift the burden of iteration to Python’s interpreter, allowing it to determine the most efficient way to process the data. Functional programming promotes clarity and efficiency by focusing on what should be done, rather than how it should be iterated.

## Sorting Functions

Python provides two key functions for sorting collections of data: **`sorted()`** and **`sort()`**. These functions allow you to arrange the elements in a list based on a specific order.

- **`sorted()`**: This function returns a **new, sorted list** from the provided iterable. It does not modify the original list and works on strings, lists, and other iterable types.
  
- **`sort()`**: This function modifies the list **in-place**, changing the original list’s order. It only works on mutable data types, such as lists. Tuples, being immutable, cannot be sorted in this way.

Both functions enable you to sort data alphabetically or numerically, with additional control over ascending or descending order, using optional arguments like `reverse=True`.
