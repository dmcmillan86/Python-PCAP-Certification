# Advanced Operations with Functions in Python

# Python Variable Scope
purpose is to know where and where not a variable is accessible from
Variables are only accessible within their scope - Global/Local
Variables defined in a function are only accessible within that function -local
Variables defined outside of a function - global
a caveat to this is a variable inside a function with keyword 'global' will be scoped globally

# Yielding Python Functions

Yield replaced 'return' and creates a sequence of results
temp suspends function execution
returns to suspended point, remembering 'state'
Is used to produce iterable results from a function

iterable results can be looped through with a for loop
